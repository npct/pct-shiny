<p>This is the online home of the open source transport planning system, the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT). The PCT is released under the <a href="http://pct.bike/kent/licence.html" target="_blank">AGP Licence</a>: it is free to use, copy and modify, e.g. to create versions for new cities and states.</p>
<p>The PCT was created by an academic team from <a href="http://www.cedar.iph.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">CEDAR</a> (University of Cambridge), the Institute for Transport Studies (<a href="http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/" target="_blank">ITS</a>)/<a href="http://cdrc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">CDRC</a> (University of Leeds), the <a href="http://westminster.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Westminster</a>, and YouthinMind. The work was initially funded by the Department for Transport (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport" target="_blank">DfT</a>) to create the National Propensity to Cycle Tool for England (PCT-England). This will be officially launched in July 2016.</p>
<p>Further information on the project can be found at the <a href="http://www.cedar.iph.cam.ac.uk/research/modelling/npct-tool/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a>, the <a href="https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/research/npct/" target="_blank">University of Leeds</a> and the <a href="https://ecf.com/news-and-events/news/national-propensity-cycle-tool-npct-project" target="_blank">European Cycling Federation</a>. The PCT was created by:</p>

<p>The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) was designed to assist transport planners and policy makers to prioritise investments and interventions to promote cycling. The PCT answers the question: “where is cycling currently common and where does cycling have the greatest potential to grow?”</p>
<p>The PCT can be used at different scales.</p>
<p>First, the PCT is a strategic planning tool. Different visons of the future are represented through various scenarios of change, including the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/364791/141015_Cycling_Delivery_Plan.pdf" target="_blank">government’s Cycling Delivery Plan</a> target to double cycling in a decade and the more ambitious ‘Go Dutch’ scenario, whereby cycling levels are reached in England (allowing for English hilliness and trip distances). By showing what the rate of cycling could feasibly look like in different parts of cities and regions, and illustrating the associated increase in cycle use on the road network, the PCT should inform policies that seek a wider shift towards sustainable transport.</p>
<p>Second, the PCT can also be used at a smaller scale. The scenario level of commuter cycling along a particular road can be used to estimate future mode share for cycling on that corridor. This can be compared with current allocation of space to different modes, and used to consider re-allocation from less sustainable modes to cater for cycling growth. In other cases, low current or potential flows may indicate a barrier, such as a major road or rail line, causing severance and lengthening trips. This could be addressed through new infrastructure such as a pedestrian and cycle bridge.</p>
<p>Central both to strategic and smaller-scale use is the question of where to prioritise high quality cycling infrastructure of sufficient capacity for a planned growth in cycling.</p>
<p>In summary the PCT is a planning support system to improve cycling provision at many levels from regions to specific points on the road network. For further work on the approach, please see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04425" target="_blank">paper</a> on the PCT <span class="citation">(Lovelace et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Brook Lyndhurst for facilitating Phase 1 of the DfT contract and Atkins for facilitating Phase 2.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank the ESRC and EPSRC for additional funding through Impact Acceleration Awards.</p>
<p>The PCT uses transparent and tested methods on the best available data. However we cannot accept liability for any loss or damage caused.</p>
