    This site is a Department for Transport funded project created with the collaboration of <a href="http://www.cedar.iph.cam.ac.uk" target="_blank">CEDAR</a>, <a href="http://cdrc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">CDRC</a>, <a href="http://westminster.ac.uk" target="_blank">University of Westminster</a> and market research specialists <a href="http://brooklyndhurst.co.uk" target="_blank">Brook Lyndhurst</a> (only for stage 1). This tool, the NPCT, will be officially launched for England in June 2016. Further information on the project can be seen at: <a href="http://www.cedar.iph.cam.ac.uk/research/modelling/npct-tool/ "target = "_blank">NPCT-Tool</a>. The NPCT academic project members include:

<p>The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) was designed to assist transport planners
and policy makers to priorities investments and interventions to promote cycling.
The key question that the PCT answers is "where is cycling currently common and
where does cycling have the greatest potential to grow?"</p>

<p>By answering this question, the PCT can be used to decide along which routes
new cycle paths should be built. By helping to identify bottle necks in the
system (e.g. unexpectedly low levels of cycling between two areas due to a physical
barrier to cycling such as a major road), the PCT can also help decide where
smaller pieces of infrastructure should go.</p>

<p>The PCT is primarily a strategic planning tool. It is intended to encourage users to think
on larger time scales and geographic scales. The temporal element of the tool is included
through the various of scenarios of change, ranging from the government's
target to double cycling in a decade to the more ambitious 'Go Dutch' scenario
whereby Dutch levels of cycling are reached in England.</p>

<p>The PCT can therefore be used as a 'visioning' tool as well as a narrowly fosused
transport planning aid. By showing what the rate of cycling could feasible look
like in different parts of cities and regions, and illustrating the associated
increase in cycle use on the road network, the PCT should inform policies that
seek a wider shift towards sustainable transport more generally.
In this context the PCT can be used, for example, to decide where to re-allocate
space away from cars and towards cycling. The Satellite view (described below)
can help with this, by showing how many lanes of the road are currently
allocated to cars. Wider policies that the PCT could help inform
include where to install new speed bumps, speed cameras, 20 mph
speed limits and where to target residents with pro-cycling policies such
as free cycle training.</p>

<p>In summary the PCT is a planning support system to improve cycling
provision at many levels from regions to specific points on the road network. </p>
