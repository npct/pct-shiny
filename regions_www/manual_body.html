<p><a href="javascript:toggleElement(&#39;a1&#39;)">1. Does hilliness matter for cycling? Do the Dutch just cycle more because the Netherlands is flatter?</a></p>
<div id="a1" style="display:none">
<p>Hilliness is certainly an important predictor of cycling levels in England, with the probability of cycling a trip falling steadily as the hilliness of the local area increases (Figure 1). Overall, people in the tenth of the population in the flattest areas are three times more likely to cycle a trip than the tenth of people in the hilliest areas (2.8% trips cycled vs 0.8%).</p>

<p>It is also true that the Netherlands is a flatter country than England. As illustrated in Figure 2, around 80% of people in the Netherlands live in areas that are below the 20th centile for local hilliness in England. Under 4% of people in the Netherlands in live in areas that are above the 50th centile for hilliness in England. Note that in both England and the Netherlands the local area is defined using administrative areas designed to contain populations of around 1500 individuals.</p>

<p>We estimated what would happen to cycling levels in England if England had the same flat topography as the Netherlands (but the existing infrastructure, travel patterns and cycling cultures). We did this by re-weighting the cycle mode share shown in Figure 1 according to the Dutch distribution of hilliness shown in Figure 2 i.e. giving much more weight to the cycling levels of those living in the flattest parts of England than those living in the hilliest parts. In this “Dutch levels of hilliness” scenario, the proportion of trips cycled in England rose from 1.7% to 2.6%. This is still ten times lower than the mode share of 26.7% actually observed in the Netherlands. So although hilliness does explain a small part of why the English cycle less than the Dutch, it still leaves a massive difference unexplained. Or to put it another way, only if cycling levels in England were increased ten-fold would “the Netherlands is flatter” become a convincing excuse for England lagging behind.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="javascript:toggleElement(&#39;a2&#39;)">2. How does propensity to cycle differ between England and the Netherlands?</a></p>
<div id="a2" style="display:none">
<p>People in the Netherlands make 26.7% of trips by bicycle, fifteen times higher than the figure of 1.7% in England. In addition, cycling in England is skewed towards younger, male cyclists (Figure 1A). By contrast in the Netherlands cycling remains common into older age, and women are in fact slightly more likely to cycle than men (Figure 1B). This means that the difference between England and the Netherlands is particularly large for women and older people (Figure 2). For example, whereas the cycle mode share is ‘only’ six times higher in the Netherlands than in England for men in their thirties, it is over 20 times higher for women in their thirties or men in their seventies and eighties. For women in their seventies and eighties, the cycle mode share is over 60 times higher in the Netherlands than in England.</p>

<p>In both countries, the probability of cycling falls rapidly as trip distance increases. Interestingly, the shape of this distance decay relationship is generally similar between the two countries (Figure 3). In other words, the Dutch achieve their higher cycling levels by boosting the relative probability that trips of all distances will be made by bicycle. This indicates that the potential to increase cycling levels in England exists for longer trips (≥ 10km) as well as for the shorter trips that are more often targeted in cycling interventions, perhaps through improved infrastructure or a more widespread adoption of electric cycles. The only noticeable difference between England and the Netherlands is that the Dutch are relatively more likely to cycle short trips ≤ 1.5 miles than the English. Plausibly, this reflects trips being cycled in the Netherlands that are more often walked in England.</p>

<p><a href="javascript:toggleElement(&#39;a3&#39;)">3. Why focus on the direct routes?</a></p>
<div id="a3" style="display:none">
<p>We give users the option of seeing either the ‘direct’ or the ‘direct’ the ‘quietest’ routes on the map. Which might people use? These routes come from the journey planner Cyclestreets.net, which helps people plan their cycling route. <a target="_blank" href=jttp://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/help/howitworks/">CycleStreets.net</a> shows three types of route, ‘direct’, ‘balanced’, and ‘quietest’. Many cyclists currently choose to take a quieter route at the cost of extra time because often the shortest route involves sharing with motor traffic on busy roads. However, even the quieter routes can still involve negotiating busy roads at times. The aim of the NPCT is not to predict exactly where people are currently cycling. Rather we are trying to prioritise where to put new infrastructure.</p>
<p>For many people, cycling with busy traffic is hugely off-putting. A systematic review carried out for this project found this particularly puts off women, and probably also older people and those riding with children.</p>
<p>So are the quietest routes for those groups, and the direct routes for others? No, because this project also shows that propensity to cycle declines more rapidly with distance for women and older people. If a quieter route creates a detour such that a 2 mile trip becomes effectively a 3 mile trip, younger men’s propensity to cycle the route will decrease 11%. But for younger women, the decline is 19%, and for older adults (60+) the propensity would decrease by 35%.</p>
<p>This hits women’s and older men’s cycling twice: they are less likely than men to want to cycle the direct route, but then are also less likely to be willing to cycle an effectively longer alternative route. It’s likely to be part of the reason for disparities in cycling by age and gender.</p>

<p>Instead, for utility trips, improving direct routes will reduce safety and time disincentives to cycling. So while a good proportion of current cyclists may use the ‘quietest’ route, a big increase in capacity will likely necessitate substantial improvements to the ‘direct’ route, which will then carry many more riders.</p>
<p>Thus we have chosen to present the ‘direct’ as the most first choice for creating good cycling routes.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="javascript:toggleElement(&#39;a4&#39;)">4. What are the estimates of future cycling rate based on?</a></p>
<div id="a4" style="display:none">
<p>The estimates of future cycling rate are based on a regression model, the results of which can be seen in the Model Output Tab.</p>
<p>To create different scenarios of the future, we used different distance decay curves. For the Dutch scenario, for example, we assumed that the likelihood of cycling a given distance was the same in the UK as it is in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The regression model also takes hilliness into account. The output is displayed in a way that focusses on the <em>absolute</em> rate of cycling rather than the <em>percentage</em> who cycle in a particular area or along a particular desire line. Thus short distance trips with a currently low rate of cycling, few hills and a high number of commutes will tend to have the highest projected increase in cycling.</p>
<p>The tool should be used interactively. By switching between different scenarios, for example, one can see how the distribution of cycling can be expected to change as cycling grows. By switching between line types, you can see whether or not ‘desire lines’ of high demand are supplied with quiet and direct routes.</p>
<p>By experimenting with the ‘Freeze lines’ option and zooming into specific areas of interest, the level of cycling at more local levels can be explored. And by setting the basemap to ‘Satellite’ when zoomed into specific parts of the road network, the space available to create new cycle paths and car-free zones can be explored.</p>
<p>Overall, there are many ways that the tool can be used to improve cycling provision. It is likely that more features will be added in future versions (if you have any suggestions, please <a href="mailto:npct@npct.org.uk">get in touch</a>). The table below explains the various options in the interactive map.</p>
