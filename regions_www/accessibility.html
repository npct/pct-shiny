      Example statement:
      https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website

      Accessibility statement for [website name]


      [Note: start with a brief explanation of which websites or mobile apps the statement covers.

      You can have a single accessibility statement that covers multiple domains, or a separate statement for each domain or subdomain. As long as the user can access relevant accessibility information easily from any page on your website.]

    -->
    <p>This statement covers the website hosted at www.pct.bike.</p>
    <p>This website is run by the Universities of Cambridge, Leeds and Westminster. See the <a href="about.html" class="uri">about page</a> for details.</p>
    <p>The web tool was developed in close collaboration with the DfT, to support delivery of the Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Strategy (CWIS): <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy" class="uri">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy</a></p>
    <p>We held multiple stakeholder workshops which led to improvements in the user interface. The tool is map based because it displays geographical information and therefore relies on a map.</p>
    <p>The main target audience is professional transport planners working for local authorities, so a level of technical knowledge is assumed when using the tool - we assume users have a PC, for example, although the tool can also work on tablets to some extent.</p>
    <p>Users can zoom-in to 300% on the main landing page and on the ‘regions’ pages such as <a href="https://www.pct.bike/m/?r=west-yorkshire" class="uri">https://www.pct.bike/m/?r=west-yorkshire</a> . At this high zoom level, the drop-down levels spill off the screen on some screens.</p>
    <p>We use the Leaflet.js library which allows panning and zooming using standard keystrokes such as Ctl+<code>+</code> for zooming in. However, there are known issues around around keyboard navigation and interaction with of popups in Leaflet maps that would require upstream development work on a <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/3210#issuecomment-96056122">third party library</a>. The text of the landing page is available as HTML. There are text summaries for the regions. None of the site has been tested with a screen reader.</p>
    <p>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand with use of headings.</p>
    <div id="how-accessible-this-website-is" class="section level2">
      <h4>How accessible this website is</h4>
      <p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The regions content cannot be accessed without use of a mouse.</li>
        <li>The manuals are provided as PDF documents. In future work provision of the manuals in HTML could improve accessibility.</li>
        <li>There is no site map.</li>
        <li>The video on the landing page lacks captions, many images lack alt tags.</li>
        <li>It is not immediately clear how to get to regional results or regional summaries which will be of most interest to many users</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our maps are intended for transport planning, not for navigational purposes, and thus are exempt.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="feedback-and-contact-information" class="section level2">
      <h4>Feedback and contact information</h4>
      <p>We do not have the resources to provide phone or in-person contact details.</p>
      <p>There is a contact email at the bottom of the About page: <a href="mailto:pct@pct.bike" class="email">pct@pct.bike</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="reporting-accessibility-problems-with-this-website" class="section level2">
      <h4>Reporting accessibility problems with this website</h4>
      <p>We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website, subject to funding. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, contact: <a href="mailto:pct@pct.bike" class="email">pct@pct.bike</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="enforcement-procedure" class="section level2">
      <h4>Enforcement procedure</h4>
      <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="technical-information-about-this-websites-accessibility" class="section level2">
      <h4>Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h4>
      <p>The PCT team is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="disproportionate-burden" class="section level2">
      <h4>Disproportionate burden</h4>
      <p>We’ve assessed the resources required for fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information, and with interactive tools and transactions. It would require substantial input from an experienced developer, beyond the resources we have available in the current contract, to improve the accessibility of the site in the following key areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>work to provide a downloadable report as HTML/Word/PDF, providing a summary of the tool, it’s key findings.</li>
        <li>make the regional summary findings more accessible, as self-standing HTML pages and add a site map</li>
        <li>improve the navigability of the site by reducing reliance on JavaScript and creating more links between website section and improving heading structure throughout the site.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in 2021.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="content-thats-not-within-the-scope-of-the-accessibility-regulations" class="section level2">
      <h4>Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h4>
      <p>The PDFs and Word documents, including the user manuals, are not essential to providing our services of informing evidence-based investment in cycling. The provision of regional summaries provide an overview of the findings. The case study PDFs provide a good overview of how the services are used in practice but are not essential.</p>
      <p>We do not plan to add captions to the video on the landing page because video recorded before September 2020 is exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="what-were-doing-to-improve-accessibility" class="section level2">
      <h4>What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h4>
      <!--
        [Note: publishing an accessibility roadmap is optional. It’s a good idea to publish one if you want to be specific about the order you’re planning to tackle accessibility issues, and there’s no space to do so in the accessibility statement itself.]
      -->
      <p>Subject to funding we plan to provide a downloadable report as HTML/Word/PDF, providing a summary of the tool, it’s key findings.</p>
      <p>We would also like to make the regional summary findings more accessible, as a sitemap. <!--
      We would like to improve the navigability of the site by reducing reliance on JavaScript and creating more links between website section and improving heading structure throughout the site.
      --> Reproducing the functionality of the map using text-based user interfaces would be a larger challenge, requiring a fundamental change to the codebase. It may be more cost effective to address this issue by creating new web services than by adapting the current PCT codebases, which is based on the web framework shiny.</p>
